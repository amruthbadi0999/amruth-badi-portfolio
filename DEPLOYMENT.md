## Environment Variables

No environment variables required for basic deployment.

## Build Configuration

The `vercel.json` file is already configured for Flask deployment:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "app.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "app.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project
   - Click "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails:**
   - Check Python version compatibility
